      <p>
        This Minneapolis staple is smart and simple: Sealing a slice of cheese inside two thin burger patties allows the burger
        to develop a serious char while the inside stays moist thanks to its molten core. There’s debate over whether the burger
        originated at 5-8 Club or Matt’s Bar; both have drawn locals and tourists alike since the 1950s. The Juicy Lucy method takes 
        some practice — you’ll need to make sure the edges of the stacked patties are properly sealed so that the melted cheese gushes
        out with every bite instead of making a mess in the skillet — but the results far outweigh the challenge. Because the ingredient
        list is short (an unassuming bun, a smattering of pickles and a pile of caramelized onions), you’ll need to season with abandon. 
        You may be tempted to use an expensive craft cheese, but sliced American cheese is the only way to go for tradition and meltability.

    <h3><strong>Yield - 4 Burgers</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
            <li>1½ pounds ground beef, at least 15 percent fat</li>
            <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion (about 1 pound), peeled and cut into ¼-inch rounds</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 to 2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 potato rolls or soft hamburger buns, split</li>
            <li>Bread-and-butter pickles, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Step 1</strong>
            In a small bowl, stir together 2 teaspoons salt and 1½ teaspoons pepper. Divide the beef 
            into four equal portions, then halve each of those portions. Gently roll each portion into 
            a ball using the palm of your hand, then flatten each into a disk shape on a large cutting 
            board, pressing with your fingers and palm until just over 4 inches wide and ¼-inch thick. 
            Repeat to form eight patties. Season both sides of each patty with the salt-and-pepper blend.

          <li><strong>Step 2</strong>
            In a small bowl, stir together 2 teaspoons salt and 1½ teaspoons pepper. Divide the beef into 
            four equal portions, then halve each of those portions. Gently roll each portion into a ball 
            using the palm of your hand, then flatten each into a disk shape on a large cutting board, 
            pressing with your fingers and palm until just over 4 inches wide and ¼-inch thick. Repeat to 
            form eight patties. Season both sides of each patty with the salt-and-pepper blend.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
            In a large (preferably 12-inch) cast-iron skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion; 
            sprinkle with sugar, 1 teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, adding
            2 tablespoons water about every 5 minutes to prevent burning, until tender and caramelized, 
            about 20 minutes. Once the onions are caramelized, transfer them to a bowl. 
            (If you have any bits left in the pan, wipe them out.)
          </li>
          <li><strong>Step 4</strong>
            Add the oil to the skillet to lightly coat the bottom and heat over medium-high until 
            scalding-hot, about 2 minutes. Add the burgers and cook until seared and dark brown on the 
            outside, 3 to 5 minutes per side. (You’ll want to let the burgers cook undisturbed as long 
            as possible to develop a crisp sear and to prevent them from splitting. Their insides will 
            cook through by the time the outsides form a proper sear. Resist the urge to cut them open, 
            as the cheese will spurt out.) Transfer burgers to a clean cutting board to rest.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Step 5</strong>
            Meanwhile, toast the buns: Scrape up and remove from the pan any cheese that may have leaked, 
            leaving a thin layer of accumulated fat in the pan. Reduce the heat to medium. Working in 
            batches, toast the buns cut-side down until warmed and toasted in spots, about 1 minute. Form
            sandwiches by layering pickles, patties, then caramelized onions on buns. Serve immediately.
