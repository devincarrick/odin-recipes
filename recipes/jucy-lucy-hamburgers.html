      <p>
        This Minneapolis staple is smart and simple: Sealing a slice of cheese inside two thin burger patties allows the burger
        to develop a serious char while the inside stays moist thanks to its molten core. There’s debate over whether the burger
        originated at 5-8 Club or Matt’s Bar; both have drawn locals and tourists alike since the 1950s. The Juicy Lucy method takes 
        some practice — you’ll need to make sure the edges of the stacked patties are properly sealed so that the melted cheese gushes
        out with every bite instead of making a mess in the skillet — but the results far outweigh the challenge. Because the ingredient
        list is short (an unassuming bun, a smattering of pickles and a pile of caramelized onions), you’ll need to season with abandon. 
        You may be tempted to use an expensive craft cheese, but sliced American cheese is the only way to go for tradition and meltability.
