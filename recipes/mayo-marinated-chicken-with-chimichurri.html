    <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>If the idea of rubbing chicken cutlets with mayo before grilling them leaves you cold,
        I relate — I felt the same way until I tried it. Now I use mayonnaise as the base for nearly
        every marinade I use, whether I’m cooking on the grill or in a cast-iron skillet indoors. 
        The magic of mayo is that it helps your other marinade ingredients spread evenly across the 
        surface of the meat, delivering more consistent flavor, while improving browning. (Don’t worry,
        the cooked meat doesn’t taste like mayo.) In this recipe, that means chicken cutlets that cook 
        through and brown in about four minutes, with deep chimichurri flavor enhanced by a post-grill 
        drizzle of fresh sauce. This recipe will work with nearly any marinade, exactly as written: 
        You could use pesto, salsa verde, bottled barbecue sauce, jarred Thai curry paste, teriyaki sauce
        or mole, all with equal success. <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020543-mayo-marinated-chicken-with-chimichurri">via NYT Cooking</a>

    <h3>Yield: 2 to 4 servings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 chicken breast cutlets (4 to 5 ounces each), pounded about ¼-inch thick</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/3 cup store-bought or homemade mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 cup chimichurri <a href= "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020544-chimichurri">(see recipe)</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Preparation</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong> 
            Combine dried oregano, paprika, red-pepper flakes and cumin, if using, in a large bowl. 
            Add hot water and a big pinch of salt and stir with a fork. Add vinegar and stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong> 
            Smash garlic with a pinch of salt in a mortar and pestle to form a rough paste, then drizzle 
            in about 2 tablespoons of olive oil and work the garlic and oil around the mortar until it 
            emulsifies and no loose oil remains. Scrape this garlic mixture into the bowl with the oregano
            mixture and stir to combine. (Alternatively, smash garlic cloves on a cutting board with the 
            flat side of a chef’s knife. Sprinkle with a pinch of kosher salt, then use the side of your
            knife to scrape the mixture back and forth until a paste forms. Drizzle a little olive oil over
            the paste and work it in with the side of the knife. Repeat until you’ve added about a 
            tablespoon of olive oil, then scrape the mixture up and transfer it to the bowl with the oregano
            mixture, add the remaining olive oil, and stir to combine.)</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
            Add minced fresh oregano and parsley and stir to combine. Set aside at room temperature for at
            least 30 minutes, or in the refrigerator overnight, to allow the dried oregano to rehydrate and
            the flavors and texture to develop. Stir vigorously before tasting, then adjust seasoning with 
            salt and fresh black pepper. Unused chimichurri can be stored in a sealed container in the 
            refrigerator for several weeks.</li>
